> Adapted from [this recipe](https://www.stetted.com/pina-colada-scones/)

## Scone Ingredients 

* 1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup coconut flour
* 1/4 cup light brown sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 cup creme de coconut
* 5 tbsp frozen butter
* 1 large egg
* 1 cup crushed pineapple, drained (keep juice for glaze
* 1/4 cup shredded coconut

## Glaze Ingredients
* 1 1/2 tbsp pineapple juice
* 1 tbsp creme de coconut
* 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
* 1/2 tsp Mexican vanilla
* pinch of salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or Silpat liner.
1. In a large bowl, mix together 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup coconut flour, 1/4 cup light brown sugar, and 2 tsp baking powder.
1. Using a medium grater, grate 5 tbsp frozen butter into flour mixture. Stir to incorporate butter but only so that butter is well-distributed throughout; you want the butter to stay in pieces and not blended in.
1. Mix in 1/4 cup creme de coconut and the egg.
1. Mix in pineapple and shredded coconut just until incorporated throughout.
1. Split dough in half.
1. For each half of dough, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gather together into a ball. Use flour to keep dough from sticking to the work area. Pat into a large circle about 1/2 inch thick, and cut into 8 wedges.
1. Transfer wedges to prepared baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes, until golden brown.
1. Let cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes.
1. To make the glaze, whisk together 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon creme de coconut, and 1 1/2 tbsp pineapple juice. Add 1/2 tsp Mexican vanilla and pinch of salt, stir until smooth and no lumps remain.
1. Drizzle over cooled scones using a fork. Let glaze set for at least 5 minutes before serving.
