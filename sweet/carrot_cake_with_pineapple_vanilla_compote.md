## Ingredients 

Cake:
* 1 pound carrots, peeled, coarsely grated
* 1 cup buttermilk, room temperature
* 2½ cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 2 teaspoons ground ginger
* ½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1½ teaspoons kosher salt
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* 4 large eggs, room temperature
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* ¾ cup (packed) dark brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ¾ cup vegetable oil

Filling:
* 1 lb fresh chopped pineapple
* 2 tbsp dark rum
* 1 vanilla bean
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* Pinch of salt

Frosting and Assembly:
* 12 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
* ¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Generous pinch of kosher salt
* 4 cups powdered sugar

## Directions

Cake
1. Preheat oven to 350°. This is an oil-based cake with no butter, so no need for room temperature ingredients.
1. Lightly coat two 9"-diameter cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottoms with parchment paper rounds; lightly coat rounds with nonstick spray.
1. Combine shred carrots and buttermilk in a medium bowl. This makes the buttermilk tenderize the carrots.
1. Whisk flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl.
1. Using a stand mixer with a whisk attatchment on high speed, beat eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until pale and thick, about 4 minutes. This is our chance to incorporate air into the dough.
1. Next, emulsify the oil into the eggs and sugar: reduce speed to medium and slowly stream in oil to the egg mixture. Allow the oil to become fully incorporated.
1. Switch to a paddle attachment and turn the stand mixer to low. 
1. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with carrot mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; mix until smooth.
1. Give the batter a final mix by hand with a spatula.
1. Scrape batter evenly into prepared pans.
1. Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35–45 minutes.
1. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes.
1. Run a knife around sides of cakes and invert onto wire rack; remove parchment. Let cool completely.

Frosting 
1. Use all room temp ingredients.
1. Use the paddle attachment for a denser cream cheese frosting, and the whisk attachment for a lighter frosting
1. Using a stand mixer on high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl until smooth, about 1 minute. The ratio of cream cheese to butter is 2:1. 
1. Beat in vanilla extract and salt.
1. Reduce speed to low and gradually mix in powdered sugar in 3 additions, pulsing to combine.
1. Increase speed to high and beat frosting until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

Assembly
1. Note that carrot cakes bake flat so they shouldn't need to be leveled.
1. Re-whip frosting before using.
1. Place 1 cake, domed side down, on a platter or cake round.
1. Pipe the edge of the first layer with frosting.
1. Use an offset spatula to fill it in with pineapple compote, and then add a full layer of cream cheese frosting on top. Tip: fill in the icing so it has more coverage to stick to.
1. Use the offset to smooth the frosting and make it a level surface. 
1. Place remaining cake layer, domed side down, on top. Fill in any gaps between the layers due to doming with frosting. This prevents pockets of air when you cut into the cake.
1. For the crumb coating, apply a thin and even layer of frosting to the top and sides. This adheres any crumbs to the surface and will make the final layer of frosting easier to spread on. Note that a cold cake helps make the crumb coating adhere and be smooth.
1. Spin and level off the sides using a bench scraper on the sides and offset spatula on the top. Wipe of excess frosting after each wipe into a separate discard frosting container to prevent contaminating your frosting with crumbs.
1. Chill 30 minutes to let crumb coating set.
1. Start by putting a blob of frosting (you will use 3-4 cups of frosting here) on the top of the cake.
1. Use a small offset spatula to apply an even all-over application to the top and sides of the cake.
1. Use the back of a spoon to swirl the frosting for a decorative texture.
